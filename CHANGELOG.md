# 2023/04/30 - 2.2.7
## Features
* Jars and Void Jars can now be filled with the Essentia Terminal
## Bugs
* Fix overflow issues when creative essentia cells coexist with other cells
* Fixed a duplication bug where ghost items in the Arcane Inscriber would drop when broken or wrenched
## Misc
* Building off AE2 Extended Life now rather than base AE2
* Converted changelog to markdown
* Relocated primary git branch to main
* Artifact name changed to reflect extended life

# 2023/03/06 - 2.2.6
* Creative Essentia Cells now list MAX_INT essentia instead of 1000. They were previously still infinite, but with
  a cap of 1000 present in the AE system would prohibit large crafts.

# 2022/07/09 - 2.2.5 Release
* Corrected Essentia cell partitioning. Previously cells could be partitioned, but this was being ignored. Now
  partitioned cells will only accept the filtered essentia.
* Improved net handling code around Arcane Crafting Terminal to handle diffs of the AE2 inventory changes rather than
  the entire inventory. Should be a bit faster.
* Fixing Essentia export buses not respecting export cards. This continued to work on the first aspect in the list,
  without checking if it was needed or not. Now this will pass to the next essentia if none would be transferred.

## Build
* Fixed a number of issues around the use of the CurseMaven plugin, probably fallout from the CurseForge API
  changes lately. Builds simply broke with missing dependencies, and some version numbers for dependent mods seemed
  shifted.
